# fourier space

`libtilt.fourier_space` contains functions for 

- extracting 2D slices from 3D discrete Fourier transforms (projection)
- inserting 2D slices into 3D discrete Fourier transforms (backprojection)
- applying phase shifts to 2D images in Fourier space (translation)

In this illustrated example we will use *libtilt* to perform 
a complete projection-backprojection cycle.
