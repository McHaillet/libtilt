# Overview

3D reconstruction from 2D projection images in Python using `PyTorch`.

*libtilt* provides Python implementations for

- making 2D projections of 3D volumes using the central slice theorem
- reconstructing 3D volumes from 2D projection images by direct Fourier inversion
- reconstructing 3D volumes from 2D projection images by weighted backprojection
